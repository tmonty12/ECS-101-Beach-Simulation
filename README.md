Read the Problem Description pdf to become familiarized with the problem.

The simulation program simulates the average profit of two coffee stands based on cost and location and the heuristic program finds a near optimal location and price for two stands to create the greatest profit per person.

To run the simulation program for all you have to do is run the module and you will be asked by the console to input the cost and locations for A1 and A2.

To run the heuristic program all you have to do is run the module and you will be asked by the console to input the cost and locations for A1 and A2.
Your inputs for this part won't really affect the end output. Because the program is running a thousand trials on each possible combination, the program takes
over a minute to complete. However, there will be print statements to the console updating you along the way.
