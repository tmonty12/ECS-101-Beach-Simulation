# ECS-Beach-Simulation
One program simulating the average profit of two coffee stands based on cost and location and another program optimizing that cost and location of two coffee stands.

To run the program for part 3 all you have to do is run the module and you will be asked by the console to input the cost and locations for A1 and A2.

To run the program for part 4 all you have to do is run the module and you will be asked by the console to input the cost and locations for A1 and A2.
Your inputs for this part won't really affect the end output. Because the program is running a thousand trials on each possible combination, the program takes
over a minute to complete. However, there will be print statements to the console updating you along the way.
